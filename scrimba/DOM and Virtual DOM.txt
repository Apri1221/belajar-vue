Vue -> Virtual DOM -> Patch (list of changes to apply the DOM and sync again) -> New DOM

Patch is smart and complex
    Removes any Vue-only code
    Will sort smartly to not patch a node unnecessarily
    Because it diffs, if the "changes" yields the same result -> nothing happens == no cost
    Might also be called = DOM Diffing (Diff)
